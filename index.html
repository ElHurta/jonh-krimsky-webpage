            USOC’s John Krimsky Jr. on ‘Sport in its Social Context’ at the IOC

            International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch
            generously granted to John Krimsky Jr. the role of describing the
            IOC’s philosophy and thoughts on “Sport in its Social Context” for
            the IOC Centennial Congress in Paris, 1994.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 12th Olympic Congress was held in Paris, and officially opened
            by the Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac, who would go on to become
            President of France in May 1995.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1st Olympic Congress was held 100 years earlier -- also in Paris
            -- and was hosted by the founder and first President of the IOC,
            Baron Pierre de Coubertin.

            His Holiness Pope John Paul II is presented with a Pan Am aircraft
            model by Mr. and Mrs. John Krimsky, the plane that carried the Holy
            Father on his global pastoral tours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pan Am had contracts with the
            Vatican to carry the Pope on the longer distances. Alitalia provided
            services within Europe. Saint John Paul II blessed all of the people
            of Pan Am.
